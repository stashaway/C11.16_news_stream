# Streamism.tv

Streamism is a live stream aggregation application designed to maximize discovery of new stream. It takes live streams from Youtube and Twitch and breaks them into categories. The user can then filter his 'feed' by these categories. In addition, the user can Watchlist channels for later viewing and Share links with friends. 

Streamism.tv supports login with a Google ID or an email address and password to store the users preference data. It uses a Node.js backend that updates a Firebase database which serves the stream information to the user.
